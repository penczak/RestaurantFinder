# RestaurantFinder
 
 This is a simple web app that demonstrates use of PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node.js (PERN stack). 

 There is a homepage that displays a table with all of the restaurants with their names, locations, price-range, and Edit and Delete buttons for each one. The Edit button takes you to the Update Restaurant page where you can enter new values for the name, location or price-range. 


 Ideas for further development:
 -Have the 'Add Restaurant' feature as a seperate page with a button from the home page leading to it
 -Add a search feature on the home page so that you can find restaurants by name or by location 
 -Add authentication and have 'Favorite' restaurants
 -Make cursor into the 'this is a link' mode when hovering over entries on home page table
